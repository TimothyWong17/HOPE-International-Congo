# HOPE-International-Congo

During my 2017 summer internship at HOPE International, I was tasked with creating a home page for our company location in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This project was very simple in that it was meant to be a static page. The tricker aspect of this project was to make it responsive to different website layouts. The design and structure of the web page was built from templates we had used previously.
